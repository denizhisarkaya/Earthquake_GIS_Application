 ## Earthquake GIS Application
Turkey-Syria seismic zone and to show these roads on the web with their explanations on the map. In our project, since the data of the closed roads around the city of Kahramanmara≈ü, which is located in the center of the earthquake zone, could not be easily obtained, an interactive web map with road information was designed. The location of the closed roads has been marked on OpenStreetMap.
A function has also been written so that users can enter information about location information and road availability. This function receives from the user the latitude, longitude and an information message. Checks whether the entered values are valid. If valid values are entered, creates a new marker and adds it to the map.
The most important solution here is to ensure that the user can instantly enter the location information and availability of damaged roads into the system on the web page we have designed, so that other users are also informed about these roads. Thus, the information about damaged or closed roads was not limited.
